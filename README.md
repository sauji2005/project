my project:  ui ux design

Task 1: Wireframing & Low-Fidelity Design

This project involves creating low-fidelity wireframes for a book-selling e-commerce website. The wireframes define the layout, navigation, and user flow without using colors or detailed visuals. Screens include homepage, categories, book listings, book details, cart, checkout, and user account pages. The focus is on usability, structure, and clear navigation.

Tool Used: Figma


Task 2: High-Fidelity UI Design

Converted the low-fidelity wireframes into a high-fidelity UI design for a book e-commerce website. Applied a consistent color palette, typography, icons, and images to create a visually appealing and user-friendly interface. The design follows UI/UX principles to ensure clarity, accessibility, and a smooth shopping experience.

Tool Used: Figma

The prototype includes navigation between homepage, book listings, book details, cart, and checkout pages, allowing users to experience the flow of the website.
