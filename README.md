Task 1: Wireframing & Low-Fidelity Design

This project involves creating low-fidelity wireframes for a book-selling e-commerce website. The wireframes define the layout, navigation, and user flow without using colors or detailed visuals. Screens include homepage, categories, book listings, book details, cart, checkout, and user account pages. The focus is on usability, structure, and clear navigation.

Tool Used: Figma
